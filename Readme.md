SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
These demo apps provide a way to see various Mashery Network APIs 
in action. They're built using Intel's Cross Platform Development
Kit (XDK) that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and 
tablets using standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).


GETTING STARTED
==================================================================
You will need to download the Intel XDK from http://xdk-software.intel.com/

You will need an API key for the platform used in the demo app. 
This is very simple and free. Just follow the directions within the Readme.md file within each sub-directory below.


SETTING UP THE API KEY IN THESE APPS
==================================================================
Once you have obtained your API key, assign the API key to the 
API key variable near the top of the file JavaScript, like so:

<pre>
	var api_key ='your_api_key_here';
</pre>
